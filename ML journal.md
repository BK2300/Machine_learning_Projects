> ðŸš² Bike Rental (Random Forest & Regularized Regression)
This was my first real solo machine learning project â€” and honestly, still the coolest one in my opinion.
I started out with some exploratory statistics to figure out the building blocks, patterns, and anomalies in the data.  
After that, I experimented with several models, including tree-based models, random forests, and a mix of **Lasso**, **Spline**, and **Regularized Regression** to predict and forecast bike rental demand.
**Note:**  
- One of my regression models (I believe it was the spline one) ended up behaving oddly, and I still canâ€™t figure out why.  
- It seemed to have an RÂ² around ~0.9, but when I combined it with Lasso to create my regularized model, the performance dropped unexpectedly. All the way down to ~.0,11.
- But the Binary tree and Random Forest was flawless did my teacher lass(clap myself on the shoulder)
